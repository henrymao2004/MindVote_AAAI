  "reddit": "Reddit operates as a pseudonymous social media platform where content visibility is determined by its upvote/downvote reputation system, with approximately 58% of users based in the U.S. and 46% holding college degrees or higher. Users typically upvote content that provides valuable information, aligns with community interests, or entertains, while downvoting posts deemed irrelevant, misleading, or low-quality. The platform's voting behavior is heavily influenced by early vote momentum and community-specific norms, with users often following established voting trends rather than making independent judgments.",
  "weibo": "Weibo operates as a semi-real-name Chinese microblogging platform where visibility is driven by reposts, comments, and likes, amplified through algorithmic surfaces such as the real-time \"Hot Search\" list that ranks ~50 trending hashtags and refreshes frequently; early momentum and community norms (e.g., fan collectives) can snowball topic exposure. The service is one of China's largest social platforms (hundreds of millions of MAUs), with discourse also shaped by government-mandated real-name registration and robust, rapid content moderation that affects which topics surface and persist. In practice, creators optimize around timeliness, hashtagging, and participation in Hot Search or \"super-topics,\" while audiences discover news and pop-culture through these ranked feeds rather than a pure vote tally."
